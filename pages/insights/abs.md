# Big Data and Semiotics to unlock Brand Impact

The exponential increase in data on consumer behavior and product marketing, remains underleveraged when it comes to packaging design innovative at leading CPG companies.

A number of practical barriers remain, including limited inhouse Data Science talent, siloed data sources, misalignment in the packaging development process to incorporate rapidly evolving consumer trends, and a lack of integrated eCommerce and packaging insight mining capabilities.

On the other hand, many promising advances in behavioral science, and machine learning, e.g. Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Third Wave AI, can help accelerate the convenient use of exponential consumer data for faster and more efficient packaging and design impact.

Responding to practitioner needs, we offer a survey of the most promising tools and technologies and illustrative case studies with technical references.

Starting with practical problems to solve for, this work offers leaders a glimpse of the art of the possible. With easy to apply examples of how AI-enabled Semiotics can help synthesize and mine eCommerce and packaging data for smarter, faster and more efficient growth and innovation.
