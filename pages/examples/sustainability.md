# Example 1: Sustainability via Voice of Customer analytics

The 2020 Sustainable Market Share Index™ finds that sustainability-marketed products are responsible for more than half of the growth in consumer packaged goods (CPGs) from 2015 to 2019, and that this growth continues despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our analysis demonstrates that sustainability-marketed products enjoy a hefty premium, continue to grow faster than their conventional counterparts and contribute to over half of the growth to overall CPG. It’s clear that brand managers who are not pursuing sustainability strategies will be increasingly left behind,” said Randi Kronthal-Sacco, Senior Scholar, Marketing and Corporate Outreach, at the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business (CSB), who led the research initiative.
