# Big Data and Semiotics helps unlock Brand Impact

The exponential increase in consumer behavior and product marketing data, has not led to a corresponding increase in packaging innovative output at leading CPG companies. A number of practical barriers remain, including limited inhouse Data Science talent, siloed data sources, mismatch in packaing development with rapidly changing consumer trends, and lack of integrated eCommerce and packaging insight mining capabilities.

On the other hand many promising advances in machine learning, e.g. Natural Language Processing and Third Wave AI, can help accelerate the convenient use of exponential consumer data for quicker and more efficient packaging impact.

Responding to practitioner needs, we offer a survey of the most promising tools and areas of technology and illustrative case studies with technical references. Starting with practical problems in mind, this work offers leaders a glimpse of the art of the possible. With easy to apply examples of how AI-enabled Semiotics can help synthesize and mine eCommerce and packaging data for smarter, faster and more efficient growth and innovation.
